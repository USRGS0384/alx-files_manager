# Express API

A simple Express API that checks the status of Redis and MongoDB, and returns statistics for users and files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Ensure MongoDB and Redis are running.
4. Run `npm run start-server` to start the server.

## Endpoints

- `GET /status`: Check if Redis and MongoDB are running.
- `GET /stats`: Get the number of users and files in the database.

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

User authentication via a token
List all files
Upload a new file
Change permission of a file
View a file
Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
